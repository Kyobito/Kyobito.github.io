Hi there, I'm Kyobito, a student, programmer, and two-time NCSF Finalist. Otherwise, I'm just your average coffee drinker (no cream, no sugar) and anime enthusiast. When I'm not working to develop my skills, I enjoy blender modeling, learning a tune on my guitar, and hanging out with friends. As for things I'm planning, I plan to one day get back into martial arts and make my club a website.
